# W&M DATA 340-03 Project Description

## Project Name 

Terms & Conditions Evaluator 

## Project Overview

“Terms & Conditions from Financial Institutions and Social Media Platforms”. We've all accepted them but did we actually read them? 

In a previous course, “Ethics in Data Science”, the issue of personal data being utilized by companies was discussed. Turns out you probably gave permission for this when you agreed to the “terms & conditions” that you didn’t really read. Because these documents are rarely read much less understood by consumers you would be amazed at to what rights you have granted the company.  At the very least it would be interesting to review these various contracts (and that's exactly what they are) in order to evaluate the complexity of these documents, and attempt to grade and/or rank them.

## Objective

Create a program, using NLP techniques, that produces a  scorecard that grades an/or ranks "terms & conditions" documents.

Extract the key elements from the documents and attempt to summarize what they stated.
