## Project Name 

Terms & Conditions Evaluator 

## Project Description

I want to study “Terms & Conditions from Financial Institutions and Social Media Platforms” because “these documents are rarely read much less understood by consumers“ in order to “evaluate the complexity of these documents, and attempt to grade and/or rank them”.

In a previous course, “Ethics in Data Science”, the issue of personal data being utilized by companies was discussed. Turns out you probably gave permission for this when you agreed to the “terms & conditions” that you didn’t really read. 



### Objective

Writing out the preliminary problems and research questions so that:

* When/if you loose sight of your objectives, you can return and reread your research design.
* you can discern and communicate your research clearly and efficiently.
* you learn best practices of documenting your research questions and methodologies.

### Outcomes

Begin the process of developing your ideas for a final project.
